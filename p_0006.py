"""
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1**2+2**2+...+10**2=385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1+2+...+10)**2=552=3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.
